# Building the OrderService #
The following command is used to build the OderService WAR file.

```
.\gradlew.bat build

```
This creates the ```ordering-service-0.1.0.jar``` in the ```./build/libs``` directory.

## Cleaning all builds ##

Run ```removeBuild.bat``` to remove the ```./build``` and the ```./buildSrc/build``` directories.
