## 1. Build the MRP solution ##

In order to build the MRP solution we will need to install some more dependencies. 

1.	To build the project, navigate to the OrderService folder with cmd/PowerShell console and initiate the build by calling the gradlew file with the parameter of the build.gradle file.
PS>.\gradlew build
Once run you can find the compiled jar file under the “build/libs” folder.


## 2. Open the solution in Eclipse ##

We recommend Eclipse IDE but you can use whatever IDE you want.
1.	To be able to add the OrderService to Eclipse as a project first we need to add the plugin.
2.	Open the file build.gradle.
3.	Add the following line into the section of plugins.
apply plugin: 'eclipse'
4.	Run the following command in the PowerShell console
PS>.\gradlew eclipse
PS>.\gradlew buildDependents
5.	Open Eclipse and create a new workspace.
6.	Right click on the Project Explorer and select import a new project.
7.	Browse to the OrderService root folder and select it
8.	Check the OrderService project and click finish.
