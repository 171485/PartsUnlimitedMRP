# Deploying Parts Unlimited MRP on DCOS #

# Introduction #

In this HOL, we will explain how you can easly deploy the Parts Unlimited MRP application on DCOS from mesosphere, using Azure Container Services (ACS) on Azure.

We are recommanding you to read and do first the [HOL on Docker](https://microsoft.github.io/PartsUnlimitedMRP/adv/adv-21-Docker.html), to understand the concept of the containers.

# Prerequisites #

* We will use the DCOS CLI, you should install it before, [read this procedure to do it](https://docs.mesosphere.com/1.7/usage/cli/install/)

# Deploy an Azure Container Services (ACS) cluster

ACS is very simple to deploy, you can do it using Azure CLI but we will use the portal for this HOL.

0. First you have to create a SSH keypair on your machine, you can do that using the **ssh-keygen** command :
