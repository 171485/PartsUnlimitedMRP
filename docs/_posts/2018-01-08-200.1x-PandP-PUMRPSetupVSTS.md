### Task 1: Set up your Visual Studio Team Services account

We want to push the application code to your Visual Studio Team Services account in
order to use Team Build for the Continuous Integration HOL.

**1.** First, navigate to your Visual Studio Team Services account by typing into a browser: 

    https://{VSTS instance name}.visualstudio.com

![](../assets/setuppumrpwithvsts-jan2018/VSTS_vs.com.png)


1. If you do not have a Visual Studio Team Services (VSTS) account, you can sign up for a free account by going to [http://www.visualstudio.com](http://www.visualstudio.com), then under Visual Studio Team Services click on **Get Started for free**

2. Sign in with your **Microsoft account**. If you do not have a Microosft account you can create on by clicking on **No account? Create one!** and following the steps.

**2.** Once at your Visual Studio Team Services account, create a new PartsUnlimitedMRP team project by clicking on the **New** button under **Recent projects & teams**. Type in the project name as *PartsUnlimitedMRP* and select *Git* as the version control, then click on **Create project**.

**3.** After the wizard creates your new team project, navigate to the PartsUnlimitedMRP team project and click on the **Code** tab on the upper-left. 

![](<../assets/setuppumrpwithvsts-jan2018/navigate_to_code.png>)

**4.** The PartsUnlimitedMRP Git repository will be empty, so copy the Clone URL of the VSTS repository to your clipboard and paste it into a text document for use later. 

![](<../assets/setuppumrpwithvsts-jan2018/copy_vsts_repo_url.png>)

**5.** Clone the **PartsUnlimitedMRP** git repository located in GitHub onto your local machine, open your command line tool and type :

    git clone https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimitedMRP.git

![](<../assets/setuppumrpwithvsts-jan2018/clone_mrp.png>)

**NOTE:** If you are running Linux on your local workstation, install git:

    sudo apt-get install git
	
**NOTE:** If you are running Windows, you have to install the git client from here:

[http://git-scm.com/download](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

**6.** Add the Clone URL of your Visual Studio Team Services repository as a new remote called **vsts** (The URL previously copied at the step 4) and push to it
your Visual Studio Team Services account. 

	cd PartsUnlimitedMRP/

	git remote add vsts <url_to_repository>

	git push -u vsts --all

**NOTE:** If it's the first time that you are using your Visual Studio Team Services subscription, it will ask you to be authenticated.

![](<../assets/setuppumrpwithvsts-jan2018/vsts_auth.png>)

**NOTE:** We added the Visual Studio Team Services repository as a remote named **vsts**, so we need to
push to that remote in the future for our changes to appear in our Visual Studio Team Services
repository.

**7.** If your refresh your **CODE** section page, Your Visual Studio Team Services account should now have a copy of the PartsUnlimitedMRP
application:
