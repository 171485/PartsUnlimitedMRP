###  Task 1: Set up a Chef Automate machine and client with an ARM template

We have a few options when looking to deploy and use a Chef Server in Azure
- **Install a clean Linux VM**: i.e. install Ubuntu sku on Azure, and then install and configure Chef Server on that VM.
- **Install Chef Automate**: This is a sku available on Azure, comes with a number of Chef services, including **Chef Server** as part of the **Chef Automate** image.
- **Hosted Chef Server**: You can sign up for a hosted Chef server account at https://manage.chef.io and use this hosted server.

We will be using the second option above using Chef Automate deployment on Azure.

If you are familiar with previous Chef products, **Chef Automate** contains **Chef Server** and it also replaces **Chef Analytics**, so deploying **Chef Automate** will provide us with the components we need.

Have a read of the <a href="https://docs.chef.io/install_chef_automate.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">Chef Automate documentation</span></a> to familiarize yourself with how it operates and is structured, if you are unfamiliar with it. 

If you are familiar with previous Chef products, Chef automate contains Chef Server and it also replaces Chef Analytics, so deploying Chef Automate will provide us with the components we need.



1. This lab calls for the use of 2 virtual machines and your local one. 
	- The Chef Automate which houses the chef server must be a Linux machine. 
	- The MRP app client will be a Linux machine.  This machine will be configured and deployed to by Chef.
	- The Chef workstation can run on Linux, Windows, or Mac. 
	
	For this lab, we will us your local machine the one in this lab will be Windows. Instead of manually creating the VMs in Azure, we are going to use an Azure Resource Management (ARM) template.
    
2. Simply click the Deploy to Azure button below and follow the wizard to deploy the Chef Automate machine. You will need
    to log in to the Azure Portal.
                                                                     
	<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoft%2FPartsUnlimitedMRP%2Fmaster%2FLabfiles%2FDevOps200.2x-InfrastructureasCode%2FDeployusingChef%2Fenv%2Fdeploychef.json" target="_blank">
		<img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/>
	</a>
	<a href="http://armviz.io/#/?load=https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoft%2FPartsUnlimitedMRP%2Fmaster%2Fdocs%2FHOL_Deploying-Using-Chef%2Fenv%2Fdeploychef.json" target="_blank">
		<img src="http://armviz.io/visualizebutton.png"/>
	</a>

    The VM will be deployed to a Resource Group along with a virtual network (VNET) and some other required resources. You can delete the resource group in order to remove all the created resources at any time.

3. You will need to select a subscription and region to deploy the Resource Group to and to supply an admin username and password and unique DNS name for the chef machine.

	![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/shotb.png)
	
	![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/shotc.png)


	Make sure to not change any other configuration as they are populated correctly for you. Make sure you make a note of the region as well as the usernames and passwords for the machine. Allow about 10 minutes for deployment and then another 10 minutes for the Chef configuration. 

4. When the deployment completes, you should see the following resources in the Azure Portal.

    ![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/shot1.png)
	![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/shot2.png)

5.  Check that Chef Automate set up. (Please use Firefox or Chrome which are already installed on the machine).

	Select the partschefip resource and copy the DNS name.

	![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/shot3.png)
	
    The _dnsaddress_ will be of the form _machinename_._region_.cloudapp.azure.com. Open a browser to https://_dnsaddress_.
    (Make sure you're going to *http`s`*, and **not** *http*). You will be prompted about an invalid certificate - it is safe to
    ignore this for the purposes of this lab. If the Chef configuration has succeeded, you should see the Chef web page and enter the VM name:

    ![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/shot4.png)

## Task 2: Configure the Chef Workstation
In this exercise, you will configure your Chef Workstation by setting up the Chef Starter Kit on your local workstation.

1. Open the Chef Development Kit shell (you should have a desktop shortcut for it) and run `chef verify`.

	![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/chef_verify.png)

	The `chef verify` command returned errors that git was not configured with your identity information.
	Proceed with step 2 to configure your identify information in git.

2. Configure your global git variables with your name and email address if you haven't already.

    ```
		git config --global user.name “YourName”
		git config --global user.email “you@yourdomain.com”
	```

	![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/git_config.png)

	Run `chef verify` again to ensure no further errors exist.

3. Now you will need to get chef starter kit for accessing Chef Automate. To get to the starter kit you will need to access the chef vm with the following path https://<dns_label>.<location>.cloudapp.azure.com/biscotti/setup 

	![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/shot6.png)

	Fill in the required details like above. Then once you have agreed to the terms and conditions you will be taken through to a page where the starter kit will automatically download.  

	![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/shot7.png)

4. Extract the Chef starter kit files to a directory like `C:\Users\<username>\chef\`.

5. Open the knife.rb file in chef-repo\.chef and check that the chef_server_url to the external FQDN (e.g. https://<chef-server-dns-name>.<region>.cloudapp.azure.com/organizations/partsunlimited). Then, save and close the file.

	![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/change_chef_url.png)

6. Change directories to the chef-repo directory in the Chef DK shell (i.e. `cd C:\Users\<username>\chef\chef-repo`). Run the following git commands: 

	```
	git init
	git add -A
	git commit -m "starter kit commit"
	```

7.  Our Chef server has an SSL certificate that is not trusted. As a result, we have to manually trust the SSL certificate in order to have our workstation communicate with the Chef server. This can also be addressed by importing a valid SSL certificate for Chef to use. Run the knife ssl fetch command:

	```ruby
	knife ssl fetch
	```


8. View the current chef-repo contents, by running other ls or

	```ruby
	dir
	```

9. Synchronize the Chef repo.

	```ruby
	knife download /
	```

10. Run the `dir` command from Step 8 again, and observe that additional files and folders have been created in the chef-repo directory. 

	![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/view_post_knife_download.png)
	![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/shot7a.png)
	
10. Commit the added files into the git repository:

	````
	git add -A
	git commit -m "knife download commit"
	````

## Task 3: Create a Cookbook
In this exercise, you will create a cookbook and recipe for the MRP app's dependencies to automate the installation of the MRP application and upload it to the Chef server. 

1. Cd into the cookbook file then use the **knife** tool to generate a cookbook template. 

	```ruby
	chef generate cookbook mrpapp
	```

 	You may also be prompted to use the command `Chef generate cookbook mrpapp`. A cookbook is a set of tasks for configuring an application or feature. It defines a scenario and everything required to support that scenario. Within a cookbook, there are a series of recipes that define a set of actions to perform. Cookbooks and recipes are written in the Ruby language. This creates an **mrpapp** directory in the `chef-repo/cookbooks/` directory that contains all of the boilerplate code that defines a cookbook and a default recipe.

	![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/view_mrp_cookbook.png)

2. Edit the `metadata.rb` file in our cookbook directory.
   
    Open `chef-repo/cookbooks/mrpapp/metadata.rb` for edit
 
	Cookbooks and recipes can leverage other cookbooks and recipes. Our cookbook will use a pre-existing recipe for managing APT repositories.

	Add the following line at the end of the file:

	```ruby
	depends 'apt'
	```

	![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/edit_metadata.png)

	Save and close the file.

3. We need to install three dependencies for our recipe: the apt cookbook, the windows cookbook, and the chef-client cookbook. This can be accomplished using the knife cookbook site command, which will download the cookbooks from the official Chef cookbook repository, [https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks](https://supermarket.chef.io/cookbooks).

	Install the apt cookbook: 

	```ruby
    knife cookbook site install apt
	```

	Install the windows cookbook:

	```ruby
    knife cookbook site install windows
	```

	Install the chef-client cookbook
	
	```ruby
    knife cookbook site install chef-client
	```

4. Switch back to the master branch (this should happen automatically but may fail).
	
		git checkout master

5.  Copy the full contents of the recipe from here: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimitedMRP/master/Labfiles/DevOps200.2x-InfrastructureasCode/DeployusingChef/final/default.rb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimitedMRP/master/Labfiles/DevOps200.2x-InfrastructureasCode/DeployusingChef/final/default.rb).

6. Open chef-repo/cookbooks/mrpapp/recipes/default.rb for edit.

	The file should look like this to start: 

	```ruby
    	↪	#
    	↪	# Cookbook Name:: mrpapp
    	↪	# Recipe:: default
    	↪	Cd site insta#
    	↪	# Copyright 2016, YOUR_COMPANY_NAME
    	↪	#
    	↪	# All rights reserved - Do Not Redistribute
    	↪	#
	```
	
    
7. Paste the contents of the recipe into the default recipe file.

	![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/edit_default.png)

	Save and close the file.

8. *The following explains what the recipe is doing to provision the application.*

	The first thing the recipe will do will be to run the 'apt' resource – this will cause our recipe to execute 'apt-get update' prior to running, to make sure the package sources on the machine are up-to-date.

	```ruby
   		↪	# Runs apt-get update
    	↪	include_recipe "apt"
	```

	Now we add an apt_repository resource to make sure that the OpenJDK repository is part of our apt repository list and up-to-date.
    
	```ruby
    	↪	# Add the Open JDK apt repo
    	↪	apt_repository 'openJDK' do
    	↪		uri 'ppa:openjdk-r/ppa'
    	↪		distribution 'trusty'
    	↪	end
	```

	Next, we will use the apt-package recipe to ensure that the OpenJDK and OpenJRE are installed. 

	```ruby
    	↪	# Install JDK and JRE
    	↪	apt_package 'openjdk-8-jdk' do
    	↪		action :install
    	↪	end
    	↪	
    	↪	apt_package 'openjdk-8-jre' do
    	↪		action :install
		↪	end
	```

	Next, we set the `JAVA_HOME` and `PATH` environment variables to reference OpenJDK.

	```ruby
    	↪	# Set Java environment variables
    	↪	ENV['JAVA_HOME'] = "/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64"
		↪	ENV['PATH'] = "#{ENV['PATH']}:/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin"
		
	```

	Next, we'll install the MongoDB database engine and Tomcat web server.

	```ruby
    	↪	# Install MongoDB
    	↪	apt_package 'mongodb' do
    	↪		action :install
    	↪	end
    	↪	
    	↪	# Install Tomcat 7
    	↪	apt_package 'tomcat7' do
    	↪		action :install
		↪	end
	```

	At this point, all of our dependencies will be installed, so we can start configuring the applications. First, we need to ensure that our MongoDB database has some baseline data in it. The remote_file resource will download a file to a specified location. It's idempotent – if the file on the server has the same checksum as the local file, it won't take any action! This also uses the "notifies" command – if the resource runs (e.g. there's a new version of the file), it sends a notification to the specified resource, telling it to run.

	```ruby
    	↪	# Load MongoDB data 
    	↪	remote_file 'mongodb_data' do
    	↪		source 'https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimitedMRP/tree/master/deploy/MongoRecords.js'
    	↪		path './MongoRecords.js'
    	↪		action :create
    	↪		notifies :run, "script[mongodb_import]", :immediately
		↪	end
	```

	Now we use a "script" resource to define what command line script should be executed to load the MongoDB data we downloaded in the previous step. This resource has its "action" set to "nothing" – this means it won't run on its own. The only time this resource will run is when it's notified by the remote_file resource we used in the previous step. So every time a new version of the MongoRecord.js file is uploaded, the recipe will download it and import it. If the MongoRecords.js file doesn't change, nothing is downloaded or imported!

	```ruby
    	↪	script 'mongodb_import' do
    	↪		interpreter "bash"
    	↪		action :nothing
    	↪		code "mongo ordering MongoRecords.js"
		↪	end
	```

	Next, we need to set the port that Tomcat will run our MRP application on. This uses a script resource to invoke a regular expression to update the `/etc/tomcat7/server.xml` file.
	
	The `not_if`action is a guard statement – if the code in the `not_if` action returns true, the resource won't execute. This lets us make sure the script will only run if it needs to run.

	Another thing to note: We are referencing an attribute called `#{node['tomcat']['mrp_port']}`. We haven't defined this value yet, but we will in the next exercise! With attributes, you can set variables, so the MRP application can run on one port on one server, or a different port on a different server.
	If the port changes, you see that it uses "notifies" to invoke a service restart.

	```ruby
    	↪	# Set tomcat port 
    	↪	script 'tomcat_port' do 
    	↪		interpreter "bash"
    	↪		code "sed -i 's/Connector port=\".*\" protocol=\"HTTP\\/1.1\"$/Connector port=\"#{node['tomcat']['mrp_port']}\" protocol=\"HTTP\\/1.1\"/g' /etc/tomcat7/server.xml"
    	↪		not_if "grep 'Connector port=\"#{node['tomcat']['mrp_port']}\" protocol=\"HTTP/1.1\"$' /etc/tomcat7/server.xml"
    	↪		notifies :restart, "service[tomcat7]", :immediately
		↪	end
	```

	Now we can download the MRP application and start running it in Tomcat. If we get a new version, it signals the Tomcat service to restart.

	```ruby
    	↪	# Install the MRP app, restart the Tomcat service if necessary
    	↪	remote_file 'mrp_app' do
    	↪		source 'https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimitedMRP/tree/master/builds/mrp.war'
    	↪		action :create
    	↪		notifies :restart, "service[tomcat7]", :immediately
		↪	end
	```

	Now we can download the MRP application and start running it in **Tomcat**. If we get a new version, it signals the Tomcat service to restart.

	```ruby
   		↪	# Install the MRP app, restart the Tomcat service if necessary
    	↪	remote_file 'mrp_app' do
    	↪		source 'https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimitedMRP/tree/master/builds/mrp.war'
    	↪		path '/var/lib/tomcat7/webapps/mrp.war'
    	↪		action :create
    	↪		notifies :restart, "service[tomcat7]", :immediately
		↪	end
	```

	We can define the Tomcat servce's desired state, which is **running**. This will cause the script to check the Tomcat service, and start it if it isn't running. We can also signal this resource to **restart** with `notifies` (see above).

	```ruby
    	↪	# Ensure Tomcat is running
    	↪	service 'tomcat7' do
    	↪		action :start
    	↪	end
	```

	Finally, we can make sure the ordering service is running. This uses a combination of remote_file and script resources to check if the ordering service needs to be killed and restarted, or if it's not running at all when it should be. The end result of this is that the ordering service will always be up and running.

	```ruby
    	↪	remote_file 'ordering_service' do
    	↪		source 'https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimitedMRP/tree/master/builds/ordering-service-0.1.0.jar'
    	↪		path './ordering-service-0.1.0.jar'
    	↪		action :create
    	↪		notifies :run, "script[stop_ordering_service]", :immediately
    	↪	end
    	↪	
    	↪	# Kill the ordering service
    	↪	script 'stop_ordering_service' do
    	↪		interpreter "bash"
    	↪	# Only run when notifed
    	↪		action :nothing
    	↪		code "pkill -f ordering-service"
    	↪		only_if "pgrep -f ordering-service"
    	↪	end
    	↪	
    	↪	# Start the ordering service. 
    	↪	script 'start_ordering_service' do
    	↪		interpreter "bash"
    	↪		code "/usr/lib/jvm/java-8-openjdk-amd64/bin/java -jar ordering-service-0.1.0.jar &"
    	↪		not_if "pgrep -f ordering-service"
    	↪	end
	```


9. Commit the added files into the git repository:

	```
    	git add .
    	git commit -m "mrp cookbook commit"
	```

10. Now that the recipe is written, we can upload the cookbooks to the Chef server. From the command line, run: 

	```ruby
    	knife cookbook upload mrpapp --include-dependencies
    	knife cookbook upload chef-client --include-dependencies
	```

	Now that we have a recipe created and all of the dependencies installed, we can upload our cookbooks and recipes to the Chef server with the knife upload command.

### Task 4: Create a Role
In this exercise, you will use knife to create a role to define a baseline set of cookbooks and attributes that can be applied to multiple servers. At the start of this task, you should be logged in to the Chef Manage web site.


1. You will need to add *knife[:editor] = "notepad"* to the knife.rb in C:\Users\GregG\parts\chef-repo\.chef as this will give you a notepad when creating the role.

2. In the chef development kit console you will need to enter the following:

	```ruby
		knife role create partsrole
	```

3. This will open a notepad where you will need to change the default_attributes to:

	```ruby
		"default_attributes": {
			"tomcat": {
				"mrp_port": 9080
			}
		},
	```

4. Update the override_attributes to:

	```ruby
		"override_attributes": {
			"chef_client": {
				"interval": "60",
				"splay": "1"
			}
		},
	```

5. Update the run_list to:

	```ruby
		"run_list": [
			"recipe[mrpapp]",
			"recipe[chef-client::service]"
		],
	```

	![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/shot11.png)

	After you finished save and exit which in the console should give you validation being.

	```ruby
		Created role[partsrole]
	```

### Task 5: Bootstrap the MRP App Server and Deploy the Application
In this exercise, you will run the knife command to bootstrap the MRP app server and assign the MRP application role .

1. You will need to create a linux vm by selecting the below you can do it automatically.

	<a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FMicrosoft%2FPartsUnlimitedMRP%2Fmaster%2FLabfiles%2FDevOps200.2x-InfrastructureasCode%2FDeployusingChef%2Fenv%2Fdeploylinux.json" target="_blank">
		<img src="http://azuredeploy.net/deploybutton.png"/>
	</a>

2. Fill in with the following details. 

		adminUsername: **azureuser**
		adminPassword: **< your admin password>**
		dnsLabelPrefix: **appmrpparts**

3. Once this is deployed use knife to boostrap the VM: 

	```ruby
		knife --% bootstrap <FQDN-for-MRP-App-VM> --ssh-user <mrp-app-admin-username> --ssh-password <mrp-app-admin-password> --node-name mrp-app --run-list role[partsrole] --sudo --verbose
	```

	![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/shot12.png)

	The script will take approximately 15 minutes to run. You will see it do the following things:

	-	Install Chef on the VM
	-	Assign the **mrp** Chef role to the VM and execute the **mrpapp** recipe.

	Once the deployment is complete, you should be able to navigate to the MRP application website and use it normally.

	If there is an error with resolving the run list you will need to run:
		
	```ruby
		knife node run_list add mrp-app 'role[partsrole]'
	```

	![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/shot_10.png)
	As this will make sure the missing role is in the node.

4. Open the URL you chose for your public DNS name in a browser. The URL should be something like `http://<mrp-dns-name>.<region>.cloudapp.azure.com:9080/mrp.`

	![](../assets/pumrpdeploywithchef-jan2018/mrp_webpage.png)

5. Click around the site and observe that it functions normally.
