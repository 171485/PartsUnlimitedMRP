In this lab, you will learn how to deploy the Parts Unlimited MRP App in an automated fashion onto a Linux VM using a hosted agent. After this lab, you will have a working, automated build in Azure DevOps (Visual Studio Team Services) that will build, test, and deploy the Parts Unlimited MRP app to a Virtual Machine in Azure.

>NOTE: Visual Studio Team Services recently changed its name to **Azure DevOps**. You will see encounter references to both product names as you step through these lab steps as we update the labs to take account of this update.

>**Note:** If you would like to trigger continuous deployments using a local agent installed on the VM instead of a hosted agent, see [this lab](https://github.com/Microsoft/PartsUnlimitedMRP/tree/master/docs/HOL_Continuous-Deployment-Using-Custom-Agent).

- Provision an MRP machine (Ubuntu VM) in Azure using an ARM template.
- Configure the release definition
- Trigger a build for continuous deployment


<h3><span style="color: #0000CD;">Estimated Lab Time:</span></h3>

- approx. 60 minutes  



### Task 1: Provision an MRP machine (Ubuntu VM) in Azure using an ARM template

1. Instead of manually creating the VM in Azure, we are going to use an Azure Resource Management (ARM) template. Simply click the **Deploy to Azure** button below and follow the wizard to deploy the machine. You will need to log in to the Azure Portal.
                                                                    
    <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMicrosoft%2FPartsUnlimitedMRP%2Fraw%2Fmaster%2FLabfiles%2FDevOps200.3x-CIandCD%2FCDwithHostedAgent%2Fenv%2FContinuousDeploymentPartsUnlimitedMRP.json" target="_blank">

    </a>
    <a href="http://armviz.io/#/?load=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FMicrosoft%2FPartsUnlimitedMRP%2Fraw%2Fmaster%2FLabfiles%2FDevOps200.3x-CIandCD%2FCDwithHostedAgent%2Fenv%2FContinuousDeploymentPartsUnlimitedMRP.json" target="_blank">
        <img src="http://armviz.io/visualizebutton.png"/>
    </a>

    The VMs will be deployed to a Resource Group along with a virtual network (VNET) and some other required resources. You can 
    delete the resource group in order to remove all the created resources at any time.

2. You will need to select a subscription and region to deploy the Resource Group to and supply an admin username, password, and unique name for the machine. The machine will be a Standard D1_V2.

    ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/set_arm_parameters.png>)

    Make sure you make a note of the region as well as the username and password for the machine. Allow about 10 minutes for deployment and MRP dependency configuration. 

3. When the deployment completes, you should see the following resources in the Azure Portal:

    ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/post_deployment_rg.png>)

    Click on the Public IP Address for your deployment. Then make a note of the DNS name:

    ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/public_ip_dns.png>)

    >**Note:** The lab requires several ports to be open, such as SSH ports and the Parts Unlimited MRP app port on the partsmrp machine. 
	The ARM template opens these ports on the machine for you. If you have time you can look through the deployment template json and .sh script that are used to deploy the Linux VM and install the dependancies for the MRP app, both are available here

### Task 2: Configure the release definition

Now we will configure a release definition in VSTS that picks up build artifacts and triggers whenever new artifacts are produced. 

1. At the homepage of the PartsUnlimitedMRP team project in Visual Studio Team Services, click on the **Build and Release** and then **Release** in the upper-left corner of the page. Then, click the **+ New pipeline** button on the home page.

    ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/new_release.png>)

2. In the ** New release pipeline** dialog, on the **Select a template** pane choose an empty template then the **Apply*** button. 

    ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/create_empty_definition.png>)

3. On the **Stage** pane, change the Stage name to **Dev**, leave the remainder of the values as they are and click the **X** in the top right hand corner to close the pane.

    ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/stagename.png>)


4. Click **+ Add an artifact**

    ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/addartifact.png>)


5. In the Add an artifact pane choose the following values

- Source Type: Build
- Project: < your project name >
- Source (build pipeline): your build pipeline name as shoudl be listed in the drop down
- default version: < accept default >
- Source alias: < accept default >

    ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/addartifact2.png>)


6. Select **Tasks** and then **Dev**

    ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/selecttasksdev1.png>)

 
7. On **Agent job** pane select **Hosted VS2017** as the agent, leave the remaining values as their defaults.

    ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/agenttype.png>)



8. On the Agent job section select the **+** sign to add a task

    ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/agentjob1.png>)

9. Add a **PowerShell** task (under the **Utility** category) and click **Add**. 

	 ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/add_powershell_script.png>)

10. In the **Powershell** script task point to the **SSH-MRP-Artifacts.ps1** build artifact as the **Script Path** in the task.

	 ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/add_script_path.png>)



11. Still in the **PowerShell** script task, add in the arguments with a hyphen and the variable name, followed by $(*variablename*). The arguments should look like the below:

    `-sshUser $(sshUser) -sshPassword $(sshPassword) -sshTarget $(sshTarget)`  

     ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/poshtaskvariables.png>)

12. Click on **Advanced** to extand the panel and ensure that the option : **Fail on Standard Error** is unchecked to avoid some garbage warning.

    ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/poshtaskerror.png>)    

13. Click on the **Variables** option and add three variables as below. Fill in the values of the virtual machine that you created previously for these variables. `sshTarget` should be the public DNS name of the virtual machine, such as "mylinuxvm.westus.cloudapp.azure.com."

    - `sshUser`
    - `sshPassword`
    - `sshTarget`

    ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/configure_variables.png>)


 

14. Click on the **Pipeline** option and then click on the **lightning icon** on the artifacts box

    ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/cdtriggerconfig.png>)
 

15. In the resultant **Continuous deployment trigger** pane enable continuous deployment, leave the default remaining values and click th **X** in the top right hand corner to close the pane.

    ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/cdtriggerconfig2.png>)

16. Save the release definition. 

### Task 3: Trigger a build for continuous deployment

Now that our release definition is set up, let's test using Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. We will trigger a build for continuous deployment by making changes to code and automatically deploying the MRP app to the hosted agent.

1. Go to the **Code** and then select **Files** tab, to go to your repo source

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/codefilessource.png>)

2. In the repo go to the location **/src/Clients/Web/pages/main/main.html** select **Edit** and modify line 17 from 

**<span class="pagetitle">Welcome to Parts Unlimited MRP system</span>**

to 

**<span class="pagetitle">Welcome to Parts Unlimited MRP system - CI1 </span>**

or something similar.

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/mainhtmltrigger1.png>)

3. Then click **Commit** to trigger a continuous Integration build

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/mainhtmltrigger2.png>)

4. Go to the **Build** tab and note the running build that was queued by the Continuous Integration trigger. 

	 ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/completed_build.png>)

5. Return to the **Release** tab and note the running deployment that was queued by the Continuous Deployment trigger. 

	![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/cdrelease1.png>)
    
6. Click on the release and then on the logs to view the log output, and also what shoudl be a successful deployment. You can click on each individual task sectin for the detailed logs.

	![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/cdreleaselogs.png>)

	![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/completed_deployment.png>)

6.  Verify your code change by navigating to the VM's public IP DNS name, such as `http://mylinuxvm.westus.cloudapp.azure.com:9080/mrp`.

    The changes you made to the home page text should be visible on the web page.

    ![](<../assets/cdhostedagent-jan2018/pumrplive.png>)

    If you encounter any issues, or failed deployment. Start by loking at the logs, to try identify where the pipeline is breakig down. Some common errors could be
    - access denied to the Linux VM > could be an incorrect password specified in the variables
    - artifact errors, or scripts breaking down > could be that artifacts are not in the format that the deployment scripts are expecting them.
