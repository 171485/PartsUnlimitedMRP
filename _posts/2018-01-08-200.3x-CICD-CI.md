title:  Continuous Integration with Visual Studio Team Services
category: CICD
order: 2
---

In this lab, we have an application called Parts Unlimited MRP. We want to set up Azure DevOps (Visual Studio Team Services) to be able continuously integrate code into the master branch of code. This means that whenever code is committed and pushed to the master branch, we want to ensure that it integrates into our code correctly to get fast feedback. To do so, we are going to be creating a build definition that will allow us to compile and run unit tests on our code every time a commit is pushed to Azure DevOps (Visual Studio Team Services).


>NOTE: Visual Studio Team Services recently changed its name to **Azure DevOps**. We are updating all labs but you will encounter references to both product names as you step through this lab until that process is complete.

### Task 1. Create a Continuous Integration Build 

In this step, you will create a build definition in Azure DevOps (Visual Studio Team Services) that will be triggered every time a commit is pushed to your repository in Azure DevOps (Visual Studio Team Services). 

>NOTE: Ensure that you have an existing PartsUnlimitedMRP team project that also contains the Git repository cloned from GitHub. If not, complete the <a href="http://microsoft.github.io/PartsUnlimitedMRP/pandp/200.1x-PandP-PUMRPSetupVSTS.html" target="_blank"><span style="color: #0066cc;" color="#0066cc">Setup PartsUnlimited MRP with VSTS</span></a> lab before going through this lab. 

>In this lab, we will be using the Hosted agent accessed via Azure DevOps (Visual Studio Team Services). If you would like to use a Self-hosted agent, either running on your  local machine or running on a VM in Azure (Azure subscription needed), you can follow instructions for setting an agent up [with this link](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/docs/build/admin/index). 

A continuous integration build will give us the ability to automate whether the code we checked in can compile and will successfully pass any automated tests that we have created against it. By using an automated build pipeline, we can quickly validate if our code changes have "broken the build" and fix code before it gets to production. 

**1.** Go to your **accountâ€™s homepage**: 

	https://<account>.visualstudio.com
	
**2.** Go to your profile page and select your team project, in this instance **PUMRP1**.

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/ProfileHomePage1.png>)

**3.** Click on the **Build and Release** then under **Builds** click on **+ New Pipeline**.

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/BuildandReleasepage1.png>)


**4.** In the **Select your repository** page accept the default values for **Select a source**, **Team project**, **Repository** and **default branch...** to point to your project repo and its master branch, as in the screensot below **Empty**, and  click **Continue**.

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/sleectasource.png>)

**5.** In the **Select a template** pane choose **Empty Pipeline**, and  click **Apply**.

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/ChooseBuildTemplate1.png>)


**6.** In the new Build Pipeline, under **Tasks** and then **Pipeline** in the  **Agent pool** drop down boa select **Hosted VS2017** as the agent type

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/chooseagenttype.png>)


**7.** Click on the **Agent job 1** section, click the  **+** button to add a task, click on **Build** and scroll down to find the **Gradle**  task. Then, click the **Add** button three times next to the Gradle task to add three Gradle tasks to the script. Gradle will be used to build the Integration Service, Order Service, and Clients components of the MRP app.

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/build_add_gradle.png>)

**8.** Select the first Gradle task and in the **Display name** box enter the the task *IntegrationService* and set the **Gradle wrapper** value to the following location (either type or browse using the **...** button):

	src/Backend/IntegrationService/gradlew

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/build_gradle_integration.png>)

**9.** Set the **Working Directory** to **src/Backend/IntegrationService** and then **uncheck** the checkbox in **JUnit Test Results** to Publish to TFS/Team Services, since we will not be running automated tests in the Integration Service. 

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/build_working_directory_integration.png>)

**10.** Select the second Gradle task and in the **Display name** box enter the the task *OrderService* and set the **Gradle Wrapper** to the following location:

	src/Backend/OrderService/gradlew

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/build_gradle_order.png>)
	
**11.** Set the **Working Directory** to the location **src/Backend/OrderService** then, under the **JUnit Test Results** , **check** the checkbox to **Publish to TFS/Team Services** , and set the **Test Results Files** field to `**/TEST-*.xml`.  

Since the Order Service **does** have unit tests in the project, we can automate running the tests as part of the build by adding in a `test` in the **Gradle tasks** field.


![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/build_working_directory_order.png>)

**12.** Select the third Gradle task and in the **Display name** box enter the the task *Clients* and set the **Gradle Wrapper** to the following location:

	src/Clients/gradlew

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/build_gradle_clients.png>)

**13.** Set the **Working Directory** to the location **src/Clients** and then **uncheck** the checkbox in **JUnit Test Results** to Publish to TFS/Team Services since we will not be running automated tests in Clients. 

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/build_working_directory_clients.png>)

**14.** Click on the **Agent job 1** section, click the  **+** button to add a task, click on **Utility** and scroll down to find the **Copy Files**  task. Then, click the **Add** button twice to add two copy files tasks. 

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/copyfilesaddtask.png>)

**15.** Still in the Add tasks pane under **Utility** and scroll down to find the **Publish Build Artifacts**  task. Then, click the **Add** button twice to add two Publish Build Artifact tasks. 

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/publishartifacttask.png>)

**16.** Select the first **Copy Files to:** task, and fill in the input values with the following:

	Source Folder: $(Build.SourcesDirectory)\src
	Contents: **/build/libs/!(buildSrc)*.?ar
	Target Folder: $(build.artifactstagingdirectory)\drop

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/copydroptask.png>)


**17.** Select the second **Copy Files to:** task, and fill in the input values with the following:

	- Source Folder: $(Build.SourcesDirectory)
	Contents:	 **/deploy/SSH-MRP-Artifacts.ps1
			**/deploy/deploy_mrp_app.sh
			**/deploy/MongoRecords.js
	Target Folder: $(build.artifactstagingdirectory)

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/copydeploytask.png>)


**18.** Select the first **Publish Build Artifact** task, and fill in the input values with the following:

	Path to publish: $(build.artifactstagingdirectory)\drop
    Artifact Name: drop
    Artifact publish location: Visual Studio Team Services/TFS

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/publishartifactdropconfig.png>)


**19.** Select the scond **Publish Build Artifact** task, and fill in the input values with the following:

	Path to publish: $(build.artifactstagingdirectory)
    Artifact Name: deploy
    Artifact publish location: Visual Studio Team Services/TFS

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/publishartifactdeployconfig.png.png>)


**20.** Go to the **Triggers** tab and **select Continuous Integration (CI)**.

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/build_ci_trigger.png>)

**21.** Click **Save and Queue**, and then select **Save** from the drop down options. Don't select the **Queue** or **Save and Queue** option as this will trigger a manual build. We will trigger a build using continuous integration rather than a manual trigger usig this quque option.

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/build_save.png>)


**22.** Go to the **Code** and then select **Files** tab, to go to your repo source

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/codefilessource.png>)

**22.** go to the location **/src/Clients/Web/pages/main/main.html** select Edit and modify line 17 from 
<span class="pagetitle">Welcome to Parts Unlimited MRP system</span>

to <span class="pagetitle">Welcome to Parts Unlimited MRP system - CI1 </span>

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/mainhtmltrigger1.png>)

**23** The click click **Commit**

![](<../assets/msci-jan2018/mainhtmltrigger2.png>)

**24.** This should have triggered the build definition we previously created. Click the **Build** tab to see the build in action.
Once complete, you should see build summary similar to this, which includes test results:

<h3><span style="color: #0000CD;"> Summary</span></h3>

In this lab, you learned how to create a Continuous Integration build that runs when new commits are pushed to the master branch. This allows you to get feedback as to whether your changes made breaking syntax changes, or if they broke one or more automated tests, or if your changes are okay. Try these labs out for next steps:
